wpdb stands for Wikipedia Database. This is an ongoing research project system that will...

* Generate a list of Wikipedia article ids via a random or pseudorandom procedure.
  * To be accepted the article must be available in 2 of the 6 target languages.
* Query the WikiMedia API for each id, for each language.
  * Metadata in the form of XML will be parsed and cleaned.
* Place clean data in the wpdb database.
