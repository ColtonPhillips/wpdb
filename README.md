Sprint goals(Feb 1):

Possible tasks (usage) :
- [ ] Empty database initialization module (init_db.py)
      * think about how you would make repairs or edits, or patches to api changes
- [ ] Construct a randomized list of n wiki articles (something1.py n output.ext)
      * later we'll do a top down approach for higher quality. this time, pure random
      * must follow a certain criteria (in 2 of 6 languages, certain quality ratings)
- [ ] Extract api variables, from said list, and puddem in a database (something2.py input.ext database)
      * These may need additional processing, computing, logic
      * This whole part needs to be abstracted so that it doesn't get messy with lots of fields.
- [ ] The fields we will be extracting must be documented (document.py, or other means)
      * There are a buttload of fields. ask me about this. - CP
